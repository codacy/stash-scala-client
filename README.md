# Stash Scala client

This is a simple library that aims to have basic functions of the Stash API.
This library was meant to support Codacy when interacting with Stash.
It is in a very early stage and all the contributions are welcome.

### Usage

Import on SBT:

```
"com.codacy" %% "stash-scala-client" % "1.1.5"
```

Usage:

```scala
val client = new StashClient("baseUrl", "consumerKey", "consumerSecret", "token", "secretToken")

val repoServices = new RepositoryServices(client)

val response = repoServices.getRepositories("projectKey")
```
